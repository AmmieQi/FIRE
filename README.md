# Filtering before Iteratively Referring for Knowledge-Grounded Response Selection in Retrieval-Based Chatbots
This repository contains the source code and datasets for the EMNLP 2020 paper [Filtering before Iteratively Referring for Knowledge-Grounded Response Selection in Retrieval-Based Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14550.pdf) by Gu et al. <br>

Our proposed **Filtering before Iteratively REferring (FIRE)** model has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance of knowledge-grounded response selection on the PERSONA-CHAT and CMU_DoG datasets.
